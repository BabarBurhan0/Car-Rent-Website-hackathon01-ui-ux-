Within a day, I finished the hackathon. All five of the pages, including the home page, are responsive. Clicking "view all" or "view all products" on the home page will take you to the categories page. The first eight products are shown on the categories page; the remaining four are only shown when you click the "show more" button. The Nissan GT automobile, the second product on the main page, has a rent now button that, when clicked, will take you to the payment page. On the last scroll, there is another rent now button, which, when clicked, would take you to the admin page. Clicking on the Nissan automobile product in the categories page will take you to the product details page. Here is a link to the entire webpage for a better understanding: https://www.linkedin.com/in/babarburhan?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=share_via&utm_content=profile&utm_medium=android_app
